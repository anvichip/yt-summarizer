The review is about the iPhone 15 series. The base variant of the iPhone 15 is assembled in India, while the Pro variants are assembled in China. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are more expensive in India compared to the USA pricing. The iPhone 15 has a Type-C port, which is a big move for Apple. It can charge other Apple devices and certain accessories and can be charged with any Type-C cable. The base variant of the iPhone 15 has a USB 2.0 port, while the Pro models have a USB 3.0 port. The Type-C port allows for connecting an HDMI cable and playing games on a larger display. The camera has been upgraded with a 48-megapixel sensor and improved HDR. The iPhone 15 Pro Max has a 5x telephoto camera and improved zoom capabilities. The cameras have software features like changing the focus and adjusting the blur level. The iPhone 15 Pro Max can also record video directly onto an SSD. The performance of the iPhone 15 series is good, but the Snapdragon 8th Gen 2 beats the A17 Pro in terms of graphics. Gaming on the iPhone 15 Pro series is enhanced with the ability to connect a PS controller and optimized gameplay with low latency. The battery life may not be the best when using the phone for gaming. The iPhone 15 base variant is a good choice with several upgrades compared to the previous model. The iPhone 13 is also a good option for those looking to save money. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are for enthusiasts who prefer Apple, but there are cheaper Android alternatives with more storage. Ultimately, the choice depends on individual preferences. The reviewer suggests comparing the iPhone 15 with the Samsung S23 Ultra or S23.
