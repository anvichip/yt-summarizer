The iPhone 15 series non-pro is a significant upgrade from previous models. It features a new dynamic island and a completely changed build. The phone supports USB-C and comes with an upgraded camera. The backside has a different texture and the whole aluminum body is very pretty. The colors are unique, with a blue cloud-like hue. The phone comes with a braided cable and a sticker with various color options. It also includes a SIM ejector tool and a standard silicone case. Compared to the previous variant, the edges are curved and the backside has a soft touch feel. The phone does not have titanium sides or an action button, but the camera is upgraded and the dynamic island feature allows for new animations and the ability to open apps like YouTube Music. The phone has a 60Hz screen and is lacking a 120Hz display, which may make it less attractive for some users. The charging capabilities are limited with a USB 2.0 port instead of the faster USB 3.1. However, the phone can be charged with an Android charger and other accessories can be connected to it. The phone offers smooth performance and gaming capabilities, but lacks the Pro series gaming enhancements. It features the Apple Standby Mode for contact transfer and voice commands. Other features include AutoCorrect upgrades, gesture capabilities during video calls, and the ability to set live photos as wallpapers. The camera is a significant upgrade with a 48 megapixel option and improved light quality, as well as a portrait mode that can be enabled in post-processing. The phone is considered a good upgrade option for those with an iPhone 13, but may not warrant an upgrade for those with an iPhone 14 Pro. The pricing remains high, although the phone is assembled in India, which may result in sales in the future. Overall, the iPhone 15 series non-pro offers a variety of new features and upgrades, making it a compelling choice for iPhone users.
