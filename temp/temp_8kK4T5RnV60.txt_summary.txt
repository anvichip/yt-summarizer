In this review, the reviewer discusses the upcoming iPhone 15 series, focusing on various features of the phones. Firstly, they mention that the iPhone 15 series will be shifting to USB Type-C, although Apple may only allow it to function with a special wire made for iPhones. The reviewer also mentions that there is pressure from Europe for Apple to make their iPhones compatible with third-party Type-C accessories. The next feature discussed is the design, with the reviewer stating that the iPhone 15 Pro series will have the same camera module and boxy frame design as the iPhone 14 Pro. However, there was a planned change to have haptic buttons for the power button and volume rockers, which was reportedly canceled during production. The iPhone 15 Pro series is said to have a frame and chassis made of titanium, giving it a more premium feel. Moving on to the display, the bezels on the iPhone 15 Pro are expected to be reduced, with rumors saying the iPhone 15 Pro Max will have the least bezels in any phone. The display is also said to be more efficient and consume less power. There is a wild rumor that the iPhone 15 Pro might have a brightness of 2500 nits, although the reviewer has doubts about this. In terms of battery, charging for the iPhone 15 Pro series is said to be officially supported at 27W. The most notable feature the reviewer discusses is the new Apple A17 processor, which will be based on 3nm and is expected to significantly increase power and efficiency. The Geekbench scores for the processor have leaked, with multi-core scores around 8000. The reviewer claims that this year, Android phones may not be able to beat the iPhone in terms of performance, as they will be using chips based on 4nm technology. Regarding the camera, both the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will have a 48MP main camera, with the Pro Max having a better telephoto zoom. The LiDAR scanner may also be improved in the Pro series. The iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 are said to have a curved display with a Dynamic Island, although they will still have a 60Hz refresh rate. The iPhone 15 series may come with a new 48MP camera sensor. The price of the Pro series is expected to increase by $200, and there were rumors of an iPhone 15 Ultra, although it has reportedly been canceled. The reviewer concludes by stating that the iPhone 15 series will be launched in September 2023 and asks viewers to guess the price of the Pro series.
